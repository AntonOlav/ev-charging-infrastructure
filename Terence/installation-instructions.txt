Installation instructions

Below are the links to the Norwegian national map catalogue for traffic volume and boundaries:

1. Traffic volume
https://kartkatalog.geonorge.no/metadata/roads-traffic-volumes/af2c4a0a-1978-4e62-b08d-ed1f36bd5023

In order to upload the entire traffic volume folder to GitHub I had to pickle one file called ‘a00000007.gdbtable’. This can be reverted in Python by following the following steps:
	import pickle
	with open(‘a00000007.gdbtable.pickle’, ‘rb’) as f:
		data=pickle.load(f)

Alternatively, install the file from the database linked above.
