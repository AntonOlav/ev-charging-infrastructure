Hello Terence,

This was my initial attempt at creating the 3D map. 
Unfortunately, during the rasterization process, the matrix is assigned a value of NA, and I am unsure of the cause.
I have made attempts to resolve the issue by adjusting parameters such as the RES, but there has been no apparent change in the outcome. 
Due to this obstacle in the initial phase, I have not been able to progress customizing the 3D map.

In light of your recent suggestions, I have decided to abandon the idea of using a country boundary dataset for rasterization and am now exploring the option of using the road network instead. Please let me know if you believe this approach to be incorrect.

If you would like to examine the dataset personally, I recommend downloading it directly from the source provided in the installation_instructions.txt file. This method appears to be more straightforward than accessing it through my GitHub folders.
Your insights and guidance on this issue would be invaluable, and I look forward to hearing from you soon. 
Thank you for your time and consideration!
