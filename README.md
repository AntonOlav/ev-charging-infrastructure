***Deterministic model: Determining roads which are underserved based on
traffic volumes and computed supply***

**OVERVIEW**

This project examines the infrastructure required to support the rapidly growing Electric Vehicle (EV) market in Norway. Utilizing real-world traffic data, alongside various programming tools and models, we provide an in-depth assessment of the existing EV charging infrastructure. Our focus is on identifying areas of high demand and potential congestion points within the charging network.

Our research is propelled by the creation of a dynamic model, designed to adapt to various parameters and assumptions, thus enabling us to capture a comprehensive picture of the infrastructure challenges. This model draws upon diverse data sources and integrates potential changes in traffic patterns, providing robust and detailed insights into the state of Norway's EV infrastructure.
