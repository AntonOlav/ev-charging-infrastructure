***Deterministic model: Determining roads which are underserved based on
traffic volumes and computed supply***

**OVERVIEW**

This project examines the infrastructure required to support the rapidly growing Electric Vehicle (EV) market in Norway. Utilizing real-world traffic data, alongside various programming tools and models, we provide an in-depth assessment of the existing EV charging infrastructure. Our focus is on identifying areas of high demand and potential congestion points within the charging network.

Our research is propelled by the creation of a dynamic model, designed to adapt to various parameters and assumptions, thus enabling us to capture a comprehensive picture of the infrastructure challenges. This model draws upon diverse data sources and integrates potential changes in traffic patterns, providing detailed insights into the state of Norway's EV infrastructure.

# Repository Guide:

1. **Main_Folder**: This is the central repository for our research and associated code. The 'drafts' subfolder contains both pertinent and peripheral work carried out during our research. It isn't necessary to peruse this to understand the project's essentials.

2. **Main_Folder/1.Data_Acquisition**: This section contains each step of the data acquisition process, which includes geo-data for network creation, traffic data for determining demand, and charging station data for supply assessment.

3. **Main_Folder/2.Constructing_Network**: Here, you will find each phase of network creation, from initial data to the simplified network.

4. **Main_Folder/3.Data_Processing**: This section houses the main model's creation and the methodology behind it.

5. **Main_Folder/4.Data_Analysis**: In this section, you will find our cost calculations for meeting infrastructure requirements, as well as the procedures for conducting sensitivity analyses.

Each folder also contains the necessary data files for executing the code files.









Repositray Guide:
1. The Main_Folder is where all the research and associated code is contained. The drafts folder contains both relevant and not-so-relevant work that we've conducted during our research. It is not needed to go through for an understanding of the project.

2. In the Main_Folder 1.Data_Aqcuisition you will find every step from the data acquisition of geo-data required for creating the network, traffic data required for determining demand and charging station data required for determining supply.

3. In the Main_Folder 2.Constructing_Network you can find every stage of network creation from the original data to the simplified network.

4. In the Main_Folder 3.Data_Processing you will find where the main model was created and how.

5. In the Main_Folder 4.Data_Analysis you will find how we calculated costs for fulfilling infrastructure needs and how the sensitivites where conducted.

Every folder also contains the needed data files for running the code files.
